# Demo Improvements TODO

## Priority 1: Fix Schema Configuration (Critical) ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Add a proper `_text_` copy field that includes all searchable fields in schema.xml
  * Replaced problematic `source="*"` with explicit copy fields
  * Added: product_title, product_description, product_bullet_point, product_brand, product_color, category, query → _text_
- [x] Set appropriate default search field in solrconfig.xml
  * Changed default field (df) from "searchable_text" to "_text_" in /select handler
- [x] Ensure field analysis chains are properly configured for text fields
  * Verified StandardTokenizer, StopFilter, LowerCase, and Synonym filters are properly configured
- [x] Test default field configuration with sample queries to verify searches return results
  * Created `demo/test_schema_config.py` - comprehensive test script for schema validation
  * Tests default field, DisMax/eDisMax handlers, field weights, and copy fields
- [x] Update schema to include proper field weights for relevance ranking
  * Enhanced DisMax: product_title^5.0, product_brand^3.0, product_bullet_point^2.0
  * Enhanced eDisMax: product_title^6.0, product_brand^4.0, multi-level phrase matching (pf, pf2, pf3)
  * Improved tie breaker values and minimum should match parameters

## Priority 2: Improve Demo Robustness ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Add validation to ensure searches return results before running optimizations
  * Added `validate_search_returns_results()` method in enhanced demo
  * Tests multiple sample queries before starting optimization
  * Provides warnings if search success rate is below threshold
- [x] Include data quality checks in the demo setup script
  * Enhanced `load_data.py` with comprehensive data quality validation
  * Checks field coverage (titles, descriptions) and data diversity (brands, locales)
  * Reports quality issues and assesses criticality level
- [x] Add fallback search configurations if default field setup fails
  * Created `preflight_validation.py` with multiple fallback configurations
  * Includes basic Lucene, simple DisMax, and multi-field DisMax fallbacks
  * Automatically tests and selects working configurations
- [x] Implement pre-flight checks to validate Solr configuration before demo execution
  * Created comprehensive `SolrDemoPreflightValidator` class
  * Validates Solr connection, collection existence, data loading, and search functionality
  * Integrated into enhanced demo as mandatory first step
- [x] Add error handling for cases where search configurations don't work as expected
  * Enhanced demo handles validation failures gracefully
  * Provides specific fix suggestions for each type of failure
  * Continues with fallback configurations when possible

## Priority 3: Enhanced Reporting

- [ ] Show sample search results for manual verification in demo output
- [ ] Add query-by-query breakdown of NDCG scores in results
- [ ] Include search result count validation in optimization reports
- [ ] Display top-scoring documents for each query to verify relevance
- [ ] Add before/after comparison showing document retrieval counts

## Priority 4: Configuration Debugging

- [ ] Create debug mode that shows actual Solr queries being executed
- [ ] Add logging of search parameters and field configurations
- [ ] Include schema validation checks in setup scripts
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for common configuration issues

## Priority 5: Demo Enhancement

- [ ] Add interactive mode where users can test queries manually
- [ ] Include performance metrics (query time, index size) in reports
- [ ] Create visualization of NDCG improvements across different strategies
- [ ] Add ability to save and compare multiple optimization runs
- [ ] Include explanation of why certain optimization strategies work better

## Technical Debt

- [ ] Review and standardize field naming conventions across schema and demo
- [ ] Ensure all demo queries use terms that actually exist in the dataset
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests for schema configuration validation
- [ ] Document expected search behavior and troubleshooting steps
