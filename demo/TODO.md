  * Verified StandardTokenizer, StopFilter, LowerCase, and Synonym filters are properly configured
- [x] Test default field configuration with sample queries to verify searches return results
  * Created `demo/test_schema_config.py` - comprehensive test script for schema validation
  * Tests default field, DisMax/eDisMax handlers, field weights, and copy fields
- [x] Update schema to include proper field weights for relevance ranking
  * Enhanced DisMax: product_title^5.0, product_brand^3.0, product_bullet_point^2.0
  * Enhanced eDisMax: product_title^6.0, product_brand^4.0, multi-level phrase matching (pf, pf2, pf3)
  * Improved tie breaker values and minimum should match parameters

## Priority 2: Improve Demo Robustness ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Add validation to ensure searches return results before running optimizations
  * Added `validate_search_returns_results()` method in enhanced demo
  * Tests multiple sample queries before starting optimization
  * Provides warnings if search success rate is below threshold
- [x] Include data quality checks in the demo setup script
  * Enhanced `load_data.py` with comprehensive data quality validation
  * Checks field coverage (titles, descriptions) and data diversity (brands, locales)
  * Reports quality issues and assesses criticality level
- [x] Add fallback search configurations if default field setup fails
  * Created `preflight_validation.py` with multiple fallback configurations
  * Includes basic Lucene, simple DisMax, and multi-field DisMax fallbacks
  * Automatically tests and selects working configurations
- [x] Implement pre-flight checks to validate Solr configuration before demo execution
  * Created comprehensive `SolrDemoPreflightValidator` class
  * Validates Solr connection, collection existence, data loading, and search functionality
  * Integrated into enhanced demo as mandatory first step
- [x] Add error handling for cases where search configurations don't work as expected
  * Enhanced demo handles validation failures gracefully
  * Provides specific fix suggestions for each type of failure
  * Continues with fallback configurations when possible

## Priority 3: Enhanced Reporting ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Show sample search results for manual verification in demo output
  * Created `demo/enhanced_reporting.py` with comprehensive reporting functionality
  * Implemented `show_sample_results_report()` method to display top search results
  * Shows rank, score, title, brand, and description snippets for manual verification
- [x] Add query-by-query breakdown of NDCG scores in results
  * Added `show_query_ndcg_breakdown()` method with detailed per-query analysis
  * Displays NDCG scores sorted by performance with color-coded indicators
  * Shows best and worst performing queries with averages
- [x] Include search result count validation in optimization reports
  * Implemented `validate_result_counts()` and `show_result_count_validation()` methods
  * Tests result availability at different depths (top 10, 20, 50, 100)
  * Provides summary statistics and identifies queries with insufficient results
- [x] Display top-scoring documents for each query to verify relevance
  * Created `show_top_scoring_documents()` method with relevance verification
  * Shows top-ranking documents with relevance judgments and indicators
  * Includes document IDs, scores, and relevance assessments for quality validation
- [x] Add before/after comparison showing document retrieval counts
  * Implemented `show_before_after_comparison()` method for optimization impact analysis
  * Compares baseline vs optimized result counts with improvement tracking
  * Shows total improvements and percentage changes in document retrieval

## Priority 4: Configuration Debugging ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Create debug mode that shows actual Solr queries being executed
  * Created `demo/debug_mode.py` with comprehensive query debugging capabilities
  * Implemented `DebugMode` class with query interception and detailed logging
  * Added `SolrQueryDebugInfo` dataclass for structured debug information
  * Created `SolrQueryInterceptor` for capturing query execution details
  * Includes timing, parameter logging, and Solr debug output analysis
- [x] Add logging of search parameters and field configurations
  * Implemented `SolrDebugLogger` with detailed parameter logging
  * Added `SolrConfigurationInspector` for schema and config analysis
  * Logs query parsers, field weights, handlers, and all search parameters
  * Saves debug sessions to JSON files for analysis
- [x] Include schema validation checks in setup scripts
  * Created `demo/schema_validation.py` with comprehensive validation framework
  * Added `SolrSchemaValidator` with critical, warning, and info level checks
  * Integrated schema validation into `demo/scripts/load_data.py`
  * Validates required fields, copy fields, field types, and search handlers
- [x] Create troubleshooting guide for common configuration issues
  * Created comprehensive `demo/troubleshooting_guide.md`
  * Covers connection issues, schema problems, handler configuration, data loading
  * Includes query execution issues, performance problems, and advanced debugging
  * Provides step-by-step solutions and diagnostic commands
  * Added common error messages with specific solutions
- [x] Enhanced demo integration with debug capabilities
  * Created `demo/run_demo_with_debug.py` for debug-enabled demo execution
  * Integrated all debug components into `DebugEnabledDemoOrchestrator`
  * Added comprehensive debug reporting and performance analysis
  * Generates detailed debug reports with recommendations

## Priority 5: Demo Enhancement

- [ ] Add interactive mode where users can test queries manually
- [ ] Include performance metrics (query time, index size) in reports
- [ ] Create visualization of NDCG improvements across different strategies
- [ ] Add ability to save and compare multiple optimization runs
- [ ] Include explanation of why certain optimization strategies work better

## Technical Debt

- [ ] Review and standardize field naming conventions across schema and demo
- [ ] Ensure all demo queries use terms that actually exist in the dataset
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests for schema configuration validation
- [ ] Document expected search behavior and troubleshooting steps
