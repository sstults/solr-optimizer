## Dependencies and Critical Path

The development follows this critical path:

1. **Core Architecture → Interfaces → Basic Agent Implementations**
   - Foundation is required before any feature work can begin

2. **Solr Execution + Metrics → Query Optimization → Advanced Features**
   - Execution and evaluation capabilities must exist before optimization agents

3. **Data Models → Persistence → API → UI**
   - Storage layer must be established before building the API
   - API must be functional before UI development

4. **Features → Tests → Documentation**
   - Features must be implemented before they can be tested
   - Features and tests must exist before documentation

## Success Criteria Measurement

For each milestone, the following criteria will be measured:

### Milestone 1: Foundation Complete
- All planned components can communicate through well-defined interfaces
- Project passes CI build with test coverage above 80%
- Basic demo runs successfully

### Milestone 2: Minimum Viable Product
- System can run a complete experiment workflow
- Metrics calculation matches expected results
- Simple query optimization improves results according to metrics
- Experiment history is properly tracked

### Milestone 3: Feature Complete
- All specialized agents can produce recommendations
- Learning-to-Rank models can be trained and applied
- Advanced Solr features can be utilized
- Visualization components show experiment progress

### Milestone 4: Release Candidate
- All tests pass with >90% coverage
- REST APIs are fully functional
- Documentation is complete and accurate
- Performance meets specified benchmarks

### Milestone 5: Production Release
- System can be deployed with minimal setup
- Documentation covers all use cases
- No critical bugs remaining
- Performance is optimized for production use

## Risk Management

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Integration issues with SolrCloud | Medium | High | Early prototyping and integration testing |
| Performance bottlenecks | Medium | Medium | Regular performance testing during development |
| Complexity of agent coordination | High | Medium | Modular design with clear interfaces |
| Scaling issues with large corpora | Medium | High | Incremental testing with increasingly large datasets |
| Compatibility issues with Solr versions | Low | High | Testing with multiple Solr versions |

## Resource Allocation

For planning purposes, resource allocation across phases is estimated as:

- **Phase 1-2**: Core development (60% of resources)
- **Phase 3-4**: Data and UI (20% of resources)
- **Phase 5-6**: Advanced features and APIs (10% of resources)
- **Phase 7-8**: Testing and documentation (10% of resources)

This allocation ensures that the core functionality receives appropriate focus while still allowing time for quality testing and documentation.
